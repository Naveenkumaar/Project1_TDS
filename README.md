# GitHub User and Repository Data Scraping Project

## Overview

This project uses the GitHub API to collect data on GitHub users based in Chicago with over 100 followers, along with details on their public repositories. The data was processed and saved into two CSV files, `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`, for further analysis.

## Key Points

- **How I scraped the data**: I used the GitHub API to search for users in Chicago with over 100 followers, then fetched up to 500 repositories per user. Cleaned and saved data into `users.csv` and `repositories.csv`.
  
- **Interesting Finding**: JavaScript was the most popular programming language among active GitHub users in Chicago, followed by Python, highlighting a strong focus on web development and data science in the local tech community.

- **Recommendation for Developers**: Developers in Chicago may benefit from engaging with local open-source projects and collaborating with peers using popular languages like JavaScript and Python to expand their network and enhance visibility.

## Files Included

- **users.csv**: Contains information about GitHub users, including login, name, location, email, bio, and other profile details.
- **repositories.csv**: Includes each user’s repository data, such as repository name, creation date, programming language, stars, and license type.
- **Code**: Python scripts used to scrape and clean the data are included for reproducibility.

## How to Use This Data

The data in `users.csv` and `repositories.csv` can provide insights into the GitHub community in Chicago, including user engagement, programming language preferences, and areas of open-source activity. These files are ready for further analysis in tools like Python, R, or Excel.

## Insights and Recommendations

The project’s findings suggest strong engagement in web development (JavaScript) and data science (Python) among GitHub users in Chicago. Developers aiming to network or collaborate can focus on contributing to high-visibility projects in these areas, or connect with local developers in similar fields.
